## Background:
The crime pattern change in California over the past few years got us equally concerned and scared for our own safety and prompted us to research about this in depth for our project. A lot of crimes have shot up in the state, including burglary, aggravated assault, racial/hate crimes, vehicle thefts, property thefts, etc which affected many known people and lead to well-known stores getting shut down. This pattern made us eager to learn more about the crimes happening around us and to provide a well-curated, interactive visual data for consumption by California residents.

## Project Overview:
Analyzing crime pattern in California pre-pandemic and post-pandemic for the years 2019 through 2022. We intend this data to be consumed by all California residents for varied purposes including home rentals, homeowners, school safety in different counties. 

## Potential questions to be answered:
1. What is the most type of crime in different counties
2. How have different crime rates trended in recent years and does it have any bearing with the pandemic
3. Can a user search for different crimes in their county for a specific year 
4. How the rate fluctuated for a specific crime through the years for different counties
5. What is the geographic distribution of specific crimes in different counties
